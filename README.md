# Exploratory-data-analysis
### This is related to data analysis I performed on different datasets using python.

Every analysis will have 2 files related to the analysis - 
1. iPython notebook .ipynb file and 
2. A .pdf file which is just converted from the ipython notebook file.


Below are the datasets that I analyzed. I will keep on updating the list as I complete analyzing more datasets.
1. Haberman's Dataset
2. Donors Choose Dataset
